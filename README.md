# esp32_generative_audio
generative audio engine for ESP32

2025 edit,, wow this was crazy bad i had no idea what i was doing. it kinda worked though, i made some really cool music with the worst synthesis functions imaginable through the esp32's built-in 8bit dac,, i remember i had some other functions including a really clicky delay but I can't find them. sometimes i worry that more sophisticated programming sounds less interesting. i still do prefer the sound of noninterpolated sampling, the crunchy artifacts that appear are sick. check my meap repository for something that actually works. im just leaving this up for my nostalgia, you have to start somewhere and i'm proud of creating this from first principles
